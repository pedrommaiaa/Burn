# Burn

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)


Burn is the bridge between [Solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate)'s optimizations 
and [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)'s user-friendliness.

## Development

**Building**
```bash
make build
```

**Testing**
```bash
make test
```

**Deployment & Verification**

Inside the [`scripts/`](./scripts/) directory are a few preconfigured scripts that can be used to deploy and verify contracts.

Scripts take inputs from the cli, using silent mode to hide any sensitive information.

NOTE: These scripts are required to be _executable_ meaning they must be made executable by running `chmod +x ./scripts/*`.

NOTE: For local deployment, make sure to run `yarn` or `npm install` before running the `deploy_local.sh` script. Otherwise, hardhat will error due to missing dependencies.

NOTE: these scripts will prompt you for the contract name and deployed addresses (when verifying). Also, they use the `-i` flag on `forge` to ask for your private key for deployment. This uses silent mode which keeps your private key from being printed to the console (and visible in logs).
